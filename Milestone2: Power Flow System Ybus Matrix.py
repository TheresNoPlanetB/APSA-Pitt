#  This is Milestone 2
#  Develop Power Flow System Ybus Matrix Checkoff

# Given transformer system ratings and winding connection configurations, transmission line conductor data, line, lengths, and tower drawings.
# This will be used to calculate the positive sequence series impedance and shunt admittance matrices.

# Use the data above and the one-line diagram to develop the positive sequence power flow system Ybus matrix.
# The computer program will be submitted along with a write up of the solution. Students are to type equations and results out rather than just copy and paste computer program outputs. Units should be included
